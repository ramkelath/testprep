There may be many business reasons to try to do this, but from a project management perspective, major additions to the project are generally discouraged. In this case, the new work is a self- contained unit of work, has no overlap with the existing work, does not fit within the project charter, and needs a different skill set. Therefore, it is best to make it a new project. The first step to answering this question is to realize that the work should be a separate project. The second step is to look at the choices and see which relates to initiating a new project. Re-estimating the project sounds like the best choice only if you did not realize that the new work should be a separate project. Verifying scope is done during project monitoring and controlling, and does not relate to the decision of whether to add work to the project.

The second project finished with a schedule variance of+100, was completed with a vastly compressed schedule, and received a letter of recommendation from the sponsor, but the product of the project was not used. The third project had 23 percent more changes than expected, had an SPI of 0.90, and 25 open items in the issue log when the project was completed.

Most project schedules are compressed by the project manager during project planning, so that is not a logical reason and cannot be the best choice.

The number of critical (or hard-to-get) resources noted has no bearing on the need to rework the project charter. Therefore, that cannot be the best choice. Take another look at the second and third projects. In the second project, the product of the project was not used. This implies many things, including the possibilities that either the project manager did not identify the requirements of all the stakeholders or that the business need for the project changed dramatically and the project manager did not notice. This indicates a major flaw in the project managers abilities. In the third project, there were 25 concerns of the stakeholders that were not addressed before the project was completed.
